# m-osh
my-own shell

# details
A built in rust shell that serves no practical use other than a hobby/learning project.
Currently supports normal commands and special ones like cd,
currently it is only capable of running 1 command at a time and doesnt support | or &&.
More updates are to be rolling as we move on.
